# 1. Project Initialization and Setup:
  ## _ Initialize the Project: 
  Start by setting up a new Node.js project with npm init to create a package.json file.
  ## _ Install Dependencies: 
  Install all the necessary dependencies using npm:bash
  npm install aws-sdk bcrypt cors dotenv express express-async-errors express-mongo-sanitize express-validator http-status-codes jsonwebtoken mongoose morgan multer multer-s3 nodemailer nodemon
# 2. Environment Configuration:
  ## _ Environment Variables: 
     Use dotenv to manage configuration settings securely.
     _ Create a .env file to store sensitive information like database URI, JWT secret, AWS credentials, and email service credentials.
  ## _ Configuration File: 
     Create a configuration file (config.js) to load and manage environment variables.

3. Database Setup:
MongoDB Connection: Use mongoose to connect to a MongoDB database.
Define schemas for users, transactions, and savings goals.
Data Sanitization: Use express-mongo-sanitize to prevent NoSQL injection attacks.
4. User Authentication and Authorization:
User Registration and Login: Implement user registration and login functionality using bcrypt for password hashing and jsonwebtoken for creating and verifying JWT tokens.
Password Management: Use nodemailer to handle password reset functionality.
5. Profile Management:
Profile Personalization: Use multer and multer-s3 to handle file uploads for profile pictures, storing them in an S3 bucket.
Profile Editing: Provide endpoints for users to update their profile details and change passwords.
6. Expense Tracking:
Transaction Management: Implement endpoints to add, edit, and view transactions, ensuring they are categorized with icons for easy visualization.
Data Validation: Use express-validator to validate incoming data.
7. Savings Goals Tracking:
Goal Management: Implement functionality for users to set, track, and update their savings goals.
8. Data Visualization:
Expense Charts: Provide endpoints to fetch transaction data for front-end visualization of spending patterns.
9. Middleware and Error Handling:
CORS: Use cors to handle cross-origin requests.
Logging: Use morgan for logging HTTP requests.
Error Handling: Use express-async-errors to manage asynchronous errors.
10. Security Measures:
Input Sanitization: Implement input sanitization to prevent XSS attacks.
Authentication Middleware: Ensure that routes handling sensitive data are protected by authentication middleware.
